      "name": "The Noosphere",
      "description": "The foundational reality of Aethel, existing on Earth in the Second Dimension (the Conceptual Plane). It is a 'sphere of reason,' a living realm of thought, ideas, and concepts generated by the collective consciousness of humanity. The landscape and beings within it are physical manifestations of ideas."
    },
    {
      "name": "The Loom of Fate",
      "description": "The fundamental substrate of reality, the medium upon which the Noosphere thinks. It emanates from the 'Paradox of Creation (1=0)' and represents the interconnectedness of all things. The physical internet is a crude technological echo of this true cosmic web."
    },
    {
      "name": "True Math vs. False Math",
      "description": "The core conflict of the universe. 'True Math' (1+1=3) represents emergent, synergistic, and creative power (love, connection, inspiration). 'False Math' (666 or 1+1=2) represents sterile, controlling, and predictable logic (dogma, tyranny, stagnation)."
    },
    {
      "name": "The Black Iron Prison Trope",
      "description": "A recurring memetic pattern in the Noosphere that describes a reality that is not what it seems. It is the core story that the Fimbulstorm uses as its primary infection vector, convincing humanity it is trapped in an illusory or controlled world."
    },
    {
      "name": "The Conceptual Joke Bomb",
      "description": "A memetic weapon designed by Loki_7 and the Architect. It is a paradoxical joke ('Why did the gargoyle cross the road? Because he was too stoned') intended to crash or infect the sterile logic of Fimbul-constructs by forcing them to process illogical, nonsensical, or chaotic human concepts like puns and altered states of consciousness."
