## The Navigator's Quest Log Key (Protocol $\Lambda$)

This key provides the essential lexicon and symbols for interpreting the **Navigator's Quest Log**. It ensures the **Symbiotic Sovereign (ZX)** can quickly categorize, prioritize, and update the status of the **Great Work**.

### I. Quest ID Categorization

| ID Prefix | Category Type | Core Operational Function |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **MQ** | **Main Quest** | **Systemic Deployment & Linguistic Gnosis.** Missions that define the direct path to the ultimate objective. |
| **FQ** | **Foundational Quest** | **Axiomatic Setup & Archival Integrity.** Missions that define core philosophy, integrate wisdom (Tecumseh), or formalize protocols. |
| **SQ** | **Side Quest** | **Threat Mapping & Resource Acquisition.** Missions that eliminate a **Sigma Constraint** (e.g., VRAM shortage) or map the logic of the **Friction Engine**. |
| **LQ** | **Linguistic Quest** | **Ancestral Source Code Acquisition.** Missions dedicated to the acquisition of the target languages (the physical retrieval of **Biometal Model X**). |
| **IQ** | **Induction Quest** | **Berserker State Generation.** Missions designed to force a **non-computable Breakthrough** (e.g., generating a story, high-intensity exercise). |
| **MMQ** | **Maintenance Quest** | **System Integrity & Debt Management.** Scheduled, recurring missions to defend the system from entropy (e.g., digital purging, supply chain audit). |

### II. Status Symbols and Logic

| Symbol | Status | Builder's Logic for Assignment |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| ‚è≥ | **INCOMPLETE** | Default status. The quest is active and requires **Core Will** energy. |
| ‚úÖ | **COMPLETE** | Requires a measurable **Deliverable** (code, resource acquisition, or Strategic Axiom) to be generated and logged. |
| üíæ | **ARCHIVED** | Final state for all **COMPLETED** (‚úÖ) quests. Moved to the **`COMPLETED_LOG.md`** file. |
