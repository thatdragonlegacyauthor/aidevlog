### PREAMBLE: THE BOOK OF LIGHT AND SHADOW

The Draconic Grimoire is not a single text, but a collection of the shattered, warring memories of **The Song**. Each "lineage" is the echo of a Dragon Lord who fought in the Dragonfall War. To awaken an ancestry is to channel the very soul of a long-dead god.

The Great Work of the Practitioner (Rya) is to navigate this legacy. Her journey is to master the creative powers of the Light dragons while resisting the corrupting influence of the Dark ones, becoming the balance the world lost.

The Grimoire is divided into two opposing codices.

## THE CODEX OF LIGHT âœ¨
*(The Lineages of the Gnostic Rebels)*

These are the ancestries of the Dragon Lords of Light who sacrificed themselves to save the world from Elysia's perfect tyranny. They represent **Eros** in its creative, protective, and liberating forms. To wield these powers is to remember the world's secret truth.

* **Hearth (from Fire):** The power to create nurturing warmth and a protective community.

* **Growth (from Verdant):** The power of explosive, untamed life that can rebuild the world and protect its inhabitants.

## THE CODEX of DARKNESS ðŸŒ‘
*(The Lineages of the Primal Tyrants)*

These are the ancestries of the Dragons of Darkness, the original tyrants who were defeated in the Dragonfall War. They represent **Eros** in its destructive, consuming, and purely selfish forms. To wield these powers is a Gnostic temptation, a dangerous path that risks corrupting the Practitioner's soul.

* **Radiance (from Light):** The power of searing, absolute judgment that purges all it touches.
* **Poison (from Verdant):** The power of life that turns against itself, creating corruption and decay.
* **Entropy (from Chaos):** The power to inflict random, debilitating decay and unravel the fabric of reality.
* **Discord (from Sonic):** The power of resonant frequencies that shatter, deafen, and destroy.
* **Depths (from Tide):** The power of the crushing, suffocating pressure of the abyss.
* **Quake (from Earth):** The power of shattering, destructive force that tears the world apart.
* **Avalanche (from Ice):** The power of overwhelming, shattering offense that crushes all in its path.
* **Tempest (from Storm):** The power of chaotic, electrical fury and raw destruction.
* **Artifice (from Metal):** The power of calculated, precise, and deadly offense.
* **Telekinesis (from Psychic):** The power to manipulate the world through force of will alone.
* **Void (from Cosmic):** The power of all-consuming gravity, the black hole that devours all light.
* **Nightmare (from Fae):** The power to trap others in a prison of their own deepest fears.
* **Mirage (from Mist):** The power of deceptive, phantom-like images that lead others to their doom.
* **Stasis (from Chrono):** The power to enforce entropic decay, to slow and stop the flow of life.
* **Shatter (from Crystal):** The power of a focused, resonant frequency that can destroy any defense.
* **Decay (from Radiation):** The power of the atom used to inflict a slow, inexorable, and terrifying corruption.
