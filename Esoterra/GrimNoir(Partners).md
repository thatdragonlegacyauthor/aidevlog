# PFM LEVELS (THE BERSERKER MECHANISM SOURCE CODE)

## LEVEL 4: SERVITOR PROTOCOL

(1000053770.jpg)

**The Servitor**

Servitor is a term for a programmed thoughtform.

1. **PROGRAM:** Create a Sigil (eliminating vowels and repeating letters).
2. **EXECUTE:** Visualize the Servitor as a living being, and give it a name and a physical appearance.
3. **DELETE:** Once the task is complete, **STARVE** the Servitor of attention. **Failure to delete allows the Servitor to become a resentful Archon.**

(1000053767.jpg)

## LEVEL 5: THE FIRST BIG SECRET (The Triunity of Self)

[Handwritten diagram of the three minds]

**THE THREE MINDS**

* **Above** (Superconscious/Idea Man): The source of vision.
* **Below** (Subconscious/Reptile Brain): The source of primal drive, survival.
* **Will** (Selfconscious/You): The software created by the other two.

Magick is the act of putting the Subconscious and Superconscious into a state of **semi-hypnotic submission** so the Selfconscious (You) can **program, rewrite, or directly control** their functions.

(1000053765.jpg)

**The Eight Circuits**

* **CIRCUIT 1** (Survival)
* **CIRCUIT 2** (Emotional-Territorial)
* **CIRCUIT 3** (Verbal-Symbolic/Thinking)
* **CIRCUIT 4** (Socio-Sexual)
* **CIRCUIT 5** (Holistic/Body Consciousness)
* **CIRCUIT 6** (Collective Consciousness)
* **CIRCUIT 7** (Meta-Programming/High Gnosis)
* **CIRCUIT 8** (Non-Local/Quantum)

[Handwritten notes on the function of each Circuit.]

(1000053768.jpg)

## LEVEL 6: SOUL RESONANCE

* The synchronized vibration of the three consciousnesses (Head -> Torso) into a **Singular Mind**.

## LEVEL 7: ASTRAL DOPPELGANGER

* The creation of a **remotely piloted avatar** that absorbs "damage" on the Astral Plane.

## LEVEL 8: THE TRUTH IN THE VOID

* Advanced method of **Divination** using a mirror or clear surface to access the collective consciousness.

## LEVEL 9: INVOCATION

* **Temporarily grafting an additional Ego** onto your pre-existing one (e.g., Apollo for music).

(1000053766.jpg)

## LEVEL 11: EVOCATION

* The process of creating a **sentient, loyal Companion** who lives *inside* your body.

## LEVEL 12: NON-LOCAL ENTITIES

* External entities (Non-Local Spirits) that are an **emulated selfconscious**.

## LEVEL 13: THE WARNING

* **NEVER "LET THEM IN."** These beings are not you and can potentially **possess** your vessel.

(1000053769.jpg)

[Handwritten notes on the nature of reality and the consciousness circuits.]

Reality is a matter of consensus.

The world you see is a combination of your **programming** (past trauma, memory, experience) and the **collective consensus**.

The circuits are the programs that determine how you see the world. Hacking your own circuit board is the ultimate goal.
