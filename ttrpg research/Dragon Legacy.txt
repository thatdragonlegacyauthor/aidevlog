Of course. Based on the files you've provided for your Dragon Legacy TTRPG, here is a summary of the core lore, factions, and key characters in the world of Eryndor.
Core World Lore
The central narrative of Eryndor is built on a lie.
    • The Public History: The commonly known history is that the world was saved from the chaotic reign of tyrannical Dragon Lords by the benevolent goddess Elysia. Her return, an event known as "The Shattering," purged the world and ushered in an era of peace and order.
    • The Secret Truth: In reality, Elysia was a being of absolute order who sought to extinguish all free will. The Shattering was not her return, but the result of a desperate ritual where the last heroic Dragon Lords and their allies sacrificed themselves to seal her away, with the world itself becoming her prison. The accepted history is a fabrication created by her followers to hide this truth.
Factions of Eryndor
The world is shaped by several powerful factions, each with its own goals and methods:
    • The Champions of Order: A zealous faction dedicated to imposing the perfect, silent order of their goddess Elysia and purging all chaos, especially draconic power.
    • Scalebound Clans: Traditionalist clans who protect their ancestral lands and the sacred Dragon's Graveyard from outsiders.
    • Arcane Dominion: A faction that seeks ultimate knowledge and power through magical experimentation, viewing morality and nature as acceptable resources to be consumed for progress.
    • Ember Concord: A fragile alliance of city-states that aims to maintain peace and prosperity through politics, trade, and diplomacy.
    • The Frostfang Packs: Survivors who honor the spirits of the hunt in the harsh tundra and protect their pack from outsiders, particularly the Arcane Dominion.
    • The Runeforge Remnants: Scholars and artisans dedicated to uncovering and preserving the lost technologies of the pre-Shattering era.
    • The Astoran Conclave: Observers who guard the ancient secrets of the Shattering, intervening only when prophecy dictates.
    • The Gilded Paw Caravan: A neutral organization that profits from conflict by treating information as the most valuable currency, selling secrets to all sides.
    • The Brood of Dragnor: A fanatical cult that seeks to "cleanse" the world in fire and chaos to bring about a new age of draconic rule.
    • The Wardens of the Wilds: Guardians who protect the natural and spiritual balance of the world from the corrupting influence of the great nations.
    • The Azure Syndicate: A criminal organization that aims to seize control of trade routes and black markets through any means necessary.
